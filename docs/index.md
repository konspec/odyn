## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central OData V4

Odyn is specifically designed to work with the [Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central OData V4 API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/api-reference/v2.0/). This API provides programmatic access to Business Central data and operations through RESTful endpoints.

## Quick Start

```python
from odyn import Odyn, BearerAuthSession

# Create an authenticated session
session = BearerAuthSession("your-access-token")

# Initialize the client
client = Odyn(
    base_url="https://your-tenant.businesscentral.dynamics.com/api/v2.0/",
    session=session
)

# Fetch data with automatic pagination
customers = client.get("customers")
print(f"Retrieved {len(customers)} customers")
```
